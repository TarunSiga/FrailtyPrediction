1. There are five columns in the Raw_Frailty_data.csv

2. The columns were Height (Inches), Weight (Pounds), Age, Grip Strength, Frailty.

3. Frailty is the condition of being weak and delicate.

4. In the frailty variable there are 'Y', and 'N'. Which means 'Yes' or 'No'.

5. With the help of the data set, one can predict whether a person is frailty or not.

6. As the process of the analysis, the raw data set should be checked for any null values or 
any errors in the data. Then the data should be cleaned.

7. The cleaned data set should be used for predicting the frailty information.  

8. As the process of analysis, the frailty values 'Y' and 'N'should be converted into '1' and '0'. 

9. It will be easier to predict the frailty condition. One of best machine learning model to predict the frailty condtion is 'Logistic Regression'

10. The data frame splits into 80% train data and 20% test data. 

11. Predictions were made based on the test data

12. The summary of the logistic regression is stored in results
